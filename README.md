# Machine Learning Exercises
Cool notebooks for machine learning!

Link to datasets:

- [HW1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set)

- [HW2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset?select=heart.csv)


Things that I have learned:

- There is no necessity to balance categorical features, (I made a mistake in HW1, HW2).
- Your target variable doesn't need to be normal (See [this](https://florianwilhelm.info/2020/05/honey_i_shrunk_the_target_variable/))
